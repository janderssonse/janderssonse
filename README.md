If it aint broken, fix it!
--------------------------------

I'm a developer with a passion for Open Source. In recent years I have shifted gears slightly (still developing though) and helped organisations improve Open Source Processes, in a practical agile way. My focus and :heart: is slightly to the tech side, as opposed to the enterprise overview side, as I like to get my hands dirty. 

Having been involved in the Open Source communities, since the early days when one traded [Fred Fish floppydisks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Fish) with Source Code on them (having exotic licenses as "send me a postcard", It has been such an interesting, incredible journey to see the ideas of sharing solutions - a.k.a Open Source - mature on all levels, from being an academia and hobbyist interest, to grow, mature and become an essential part of our Global Infrastructure. 

üå± I have a soft ‚ù§Ô∏è for translations/languages, developer tooling, Open Source practices and licensing and retro computing.

üï∞Ô∏è Well, I'm always eager to get together and hack, or discuss solving problems and how to improve Open Source or agility. 

Projects I intend to keep developing are moved to 
- GitHub: https://github.com/itiquette
- Page with related stuff: https://itiquette.github.io/

whereas this area is a place for contributing, experimenting and old archived projects.

Have fun, happy hacking!

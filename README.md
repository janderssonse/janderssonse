### Hi there 👋

I'm a senior developer and Open Source Specialist. In recent years I have shifted gears slightly (still developing though) and helped organisations improve the Open Source Processes, in a practical way - whether it be education, implementation and best practices, talking to the legal or business side or something else. My focus and :heart: is slightly to the tech side, as opposed to the enterprise overview side, as I like to get my hands dirty in a practical way. 


Currently, I'm working at https://github.com/diggsweden - the 🇸🇪 Swedish Digital Government Agency - where I partially develop, and partially help out improving their ongoing efforts regarding Open Source processing and practicality!

🌱 I'm currently learning, as much as I can about Digital Identity Domains, and Open Shift with tooling. In general, I have a soft ❤️ for translations/languages, developer tooling, dev. tooling, Open Source practices and licensing - and retro computing!

🥔 I'm involved in too many projects:) Have a look at my contribution history, even of that is roughly half of where I have contributed - I have a few of my own, then I try to fix and contribute to Open Source projects. I'm also partially involved in the translation scene of Open Source software, even though my time there is limited now-a-days.

🕰️ Well, I'm always eager to get together and hack, or discuss solving problems and how to improve Open Source or agility. Or more personal interests as renovation, nature walks, odd cola soft drinks, vinyl or comics!

Have fun, happy hacking!

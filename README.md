### Hi there 👋

I'm a senior developer and Open Source Nerd. In recent years I have shifted gears slightly (still developing though) and helped organisations improve the Open Source Processes, in a practical way - whether it be education, implementation and best practices, talking to the legal or business side or something else. My focus and :heart: is slightly to the tech side, as opposed to the enterprise overview side, as I like to get my hands dirty in a practical way. 


Currently, I'm working at [DIGG - the Swedish Digital Government Agency 🇸🇪](https://github.com/diggsweden) - where I partially develop, and partially help out improving their ongoing efforts regarding Open Source processing and practicality!

Having been involved in the Open Source communities, since the early days when one as a kid traded [Fred Fish floppydisks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Fish) with Source Code on them (having exotic licenses as "send me a postcard" etc. on them:), It has been such an interesting, rewarding and incredible journey to see Open Source mature on all levels, from being an academia and hobbyist interest, to grow, mature and become the essential part of our Global Infrastructure it is today. 

🌱 I'm currently learning, as much as I can about Digital Identity Domains, and Open Shift with tooling. In general, I have a soft ❤️ for translations/languages, developer tooling, dev. tooling, Open Source practices and licensing - and retro computing!

🥔 I'm involved in too many projects:) I have a few projects of my own, then I try to fix and contribute to Open Source projects. I'm also partially involved in the translation scene of Open Source software, even though my time there is limited now-a-days.

🕰️ Well, I'm always eager to get together and hack, or discuss solving problems and how to improve Open Source or agility. Or more personal interests as renovation, nature walks, odd cola soft drinks, vinyl or comics!

Have fun, happy hacking!

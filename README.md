### Hi there 👋

I'm a developer with a passion for Open Source. In recent years I have shifted gears slightly (still developing though) and helped organisations improve the Open Source Processes, in a practical way. My focus and :heart: is slightly to the tech side, as opposed to the enterprise overview side, as I like to get my hands dirty in a practical way. 

Currently, I'm working at [DIGG - the Swedish Digital Government Agency 🇸🇪](https://github.com/diggsweden) - where I partially develop interesting services, and partially help out improving their ongoing efforts regarding Open Source processing and practicality!

Having been involved in the Open Source communities, since the early days when one as a kid traded [Fred Fish floppydisks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Fish) with Source Code on them (having exotic licenses as "send me a postcard" etc. on them:), It has been such an interesting, rewarding and incredible journey to see Open Source mature on all levels, from being an academia and hobbyist interest, to grow, mature and become the essential part of our Global Infrastructure it is today. 

🌱 Besides the rapidly changing and maturing Open Source world, I'm currently learning, as much as I can about Digital Identity Domains, and Open Shift with tooling. In general, I have a soft ❤️ for translations/languages, developer tooling, dev. tooling, Open Source practices and licensing - and retro computing!

🕰️ Well, I'm always eager to get together and hack, or discuss solving problems and how to improve Open Source or agility. 

Have fun, happy hacking!
